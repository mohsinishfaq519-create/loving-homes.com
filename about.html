            <h1>About Loving Homes</h1>
            <p>Loving Homes began with a simple idea — to create a safe, happy, and comfortable place for dogs when their owners are away. 
    The founders noticed that many pet owners struggled to find trustworthy care for their dogs, so they decided to build a daycare 
    that treats every pet like family.</p>

    <p>What started as a small space for a few dogs has grown into a full-service dog hotel with modern rooms, outdoor play areas, 
    and professional caregivers. At Loving Homes, we believe that every dog deserves love, attention, and fun. Our mission is to 
    provide that through personalized care and a warm environment.</p>

    <p>Our team is made up of passionate animal lovers who have years of experience working with dogs of all breeds and sizes. 
    We make sure every pet feels safe, clean, and cared for during their stay. Whether its a short visit or a longer stay, 
    we aim to make your dogs time with us as enjoyable and stress-free as possible.</p>

    <p>At Loving Homes, we dont just look after dogs — we build trust with owners. You can leave your pet knowing theyre in 
    loving hands, receiving care and attention every single day.</p>
